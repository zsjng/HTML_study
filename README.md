# HTML_study
study HTML based on [https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)

when you open a html file with browser, you should always open develop tools with `F12`(microsoft edge: `Ctrl + U`) to see the source page.  
so that you can get more information about HTML . I will type what I think about in source page.  
Each HTML example will code first, then effects. eg:  
`&lt;p style="color: tomato">This is text with color tomato.&lt;/p>`
<p style="color: tomato">This is text with color tomato.</p>    
Finally, let's study together.
