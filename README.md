# HTML_study
study HTML based on [https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)

#### How to use: download sources and open with browser or webstorm.  
when you open a html file with browser, you should always open develop tools with `F12`(microsoft edge: `Ctrl + U`) to see the source page.  
so that you can get more information about HTML . I will type what I think about in source page.  
Each HTML example will code first, then effects. eg:  
`<p style="color: tomato">This is text with color tomato.</p>`  
This is text with color tomato.(with tomato color)  
Finally, let's study together.
